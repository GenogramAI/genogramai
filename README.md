## What Is a Genogram?

A **genogram** is a detailed family diagram used by therapists, counselors, social workers, and medical professionals to map **multi-generational family patterns**. Unlike a basic family tree that only tracks lineage, a genogram captures the full picture of a family system:

- **Emotional relationships** — closeness, conflict, estrangement, fusion, abuse dynamics
- **Medical history** — hereditary conditions, mental health patterns, substance use across generations
- **Structural relationships** — marriages, divorces, separations, cohabitations, affairs
- **Demographics** — gender identity, sexual orientation, cultural heritage, religion, social class

Genograms follow the **McGoldrick-Gerson notation system**, a clinical standard used worldwide in family systems therapy, medical practice, and social work. They are a foundational tool in training programs for marriage and family therapy (MFT), clinical social work (LCSW), and psychiatric nursing.

### Genogram vs Family Tree: What's the Difference?

| | Family Tree | Genogram |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Genealogy & ancestry | Clinical assessment & therapy |
| **Relationships** | Biological lineage only | Emotional dynamics, conflict, closeness, abuse |
| **Medical data** | Rarely included | Core feature — tracks hereditary patterns |
| **Notation** | Informal, varies | Standardized (McGoldrick-Gerson symbols) |
| **Used by** | Hobbyists, genealogists | Therapists, doctors, social workers, researchers |
| **Generations** | As many as possible | Typically 3 generations (focused depth) |

## The Problem: Why Genograms Are Hard to Make

Creating a genogram has traditionally been a painful, time-consuming process:

**1. Manual drawing takes hours.**
A detailed 3-generation genogram with emotional relationships, medical history, and structural dynamics can take 2–4 hours to draw by hand or in generic diagramming software like Visio or Lucidchart. Every symbol must be placed correctly according to McGoldrick notation. Every line type must match the relationship it represents.

**2. Existing genogram software is outdated.**
Most genogram tools available today are desktop-only applications originally built in the 2000s. Many require Java or Flash. They have clunky interfaces, no cloud sync, no collaboration, and no mobile access. For a profession that increasingly works across devices and locations, this is a real barrier.

**3. There's no way to digitize paper genograms.**
Therapists, social workers, and counselors have years — sometimes decades — of hand-drawn genograms in client files, notebooks, and whiteboards. There has never been a practical way to convert these to digital format without manually redrawing every single one.

**4. Relationship modeling is shallow.**
Most tools handle "married" and "divorced" but fail to capture the nuanced emotional dynamics that make genograms clinically useful: enmeshment, triangulation, emotional cutoffs, fused-conflict patterns, multi-generational abuse cycles. These are the patterns therapists actually need to see.

**5. No tool helps you analyze what you've built.**
After investing hours creating a genogram, clinicians still have to manually scan for patterns — multigenerational transmission, repeated triangles, medical clustering. There's no software that helps surface these clinical insights.

## How GenogramAI Solves This

GenogramAI is a **modern, AI-powered genogram maker** built specifically for mental health professionals, medical practitioners, researchers, and students. It uses Google's Gemini AI to make genogram creation fast, accurate, and insight-driven.

### Generate Genograms From Natural Language

Describe a family in plain text, and GenogramAI builds the complete genogram automatically:

> *"John (b. 1960) married Mary (b. 1962) in 1985. They have two children: Sarah (b. 1987) who is married to Tom, and Mike (b. 1990) who struggles with depression. John's father was an alcoholic who died of liver disease at 65. Mary's parents divorced when she was 10 — she's been estranged from her father ever since."*

GenogramAI parses this into a structured, interactive genogram with correct McGoldrick symbols, relationship lines, medical quadrant markers, and generational layout — in seconds, not hours.

### Digitize Hand-Drawn Genograms From Photos

Take a picture of a hand-drawn or printed genogram, upload it, and GenogramAI's **vision AI extracts the family structure**: people, relationships, names, dates, and symbols. Years of paper genograms can be digitized without redrawing a single line.

This works with:
- Pen-and-paper genograms from therapy sessions
- Whiteboard diagrams from clinical supervision
- Printed genograms from textbooks or case studies
- Scanned documents from client files

### Edit Genograms With Conversational AI

Once a genogram exists, modify it by chatting in natural language:

> *"Add a brother for Sarah named David, born 1989. He's estranged from his father and has a history of substance abuse."*

The AI understands the existing family context, applies the change with correct symbols and positioning, and maintains the full structure. Multi-turn conversations support complex, incremental modifications — just like talking through a case with a colleague.

### Get Clinical Insights Automatically

GenogramAI analyzes the family system and surfaces patterns using established **family systems therapy frameworks**:

- **Multigenerational transmission** — Recurring behavioral, emotional, or medical patterns across generations
- **Triangulation** — Three-person dynamics that stabilize dysfunctional relationships
- **Emotional cutoffs** — Severed connections and their downstream effects
- **Medical pattern clustering** — Hereditary conditions appearing across family lines
- **Relationship dynamics** — Fusion, conflict escalation, distancing, enmeshment patterns

These insights are generated with category tags and clinical language, ready to inform case conceptualization and treatment planning.

### GEDCOM Import & Export

Already have family data in genealogy software like Ancestry, FamilySearch, or Gramps? Import via **GEDCOM 5.5.1 or 7.0** format. GenogramAI enriches basic genealogy data with AI-suggested emotional relationships, medical history, and clinical annotations — **bridging the gap between genealogy and clinical genograms**.

Export back to GEDCOM 7.0 with custom extensions for clinical data, making your work portable across platforms.

### Smart Auto-Layout

GenogramAI includes a **custom hierarchical layout engine** built specifically for genograms. Unlike generic graph layouts (force-directed, tree, etc.), it understands:

- Generational alignment (grandparents → parents → children on distinct levels)
- Spouse positioning (partners side-by-side, not scattered)
- Multi-partner handling (remarriage, affairs rendered clearly)
- Contour packing (tight, readable layouts even for large families)

The result: diagrams that look like what a trained clinician would draw by hand.

### Publishing & Sharing

- **Shareable links** — Generate public URLs for any genogram
- **Password protection** — Restrict access for confidentiality
- **Copy/export controls** — Disable downloading for sensitive cases
